This repository is for writeups I complete for various hacking chalenges or other technical concepts.

# [redTeamingStrategies](https://github.com/jethrop/writeups/tree/main/redTeamingStrategies)
These are writeups completed for my IT420, red teaming strategies class at ensign college. The writeups are formated as a chronological documentation of the process I took to complete the class clabs. In the IT420 we completed four attack paths, each path consisting of 4-5 techniques that walked through the four main stages of a penetration test or hack:

    Initial Compromise
    Pivot and Escalate
    Persistence
    C2 and EXFIL
