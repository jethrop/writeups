These are writeups completed for my IT420, red teaming strategies class at ensign college.  In this class we completed four attack paths, each path consisting of 4-5 techniques that walked through the four main stages of a penetration test:
1. Initial Compromise
2. Pivot and Escalate
3. Persistence
4. C2 and EXFIL

The attack paths were based on the cybersecurity card game Backdoors and Breaches which is in turn based on the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

Note that the class is currently ongoing and will be till mid April.  As such the writeup documentation is somewhat incomplete.
