These are writeups completed for my IT420, red teaming strategies class at ensign college.  The writeups are formated as a chronological documentation of the process I took to complete the class clabs.  In the IT420 we completed four attack paths, each path consisting of 4-5 techniques that walked through the four main stages of a penetration test or hack:
1. Initial Compromise
2. Pivot and Escalate
3. Persistence
4. C2 and EXFIL

The attack paths were based on the cybersecurity card game Backdoors and Breaches which is in turn based on the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

Note that the writeups were written in the context of a college course and some assumptions about technical and environment understanding are assumed.
The writeup documentation is somewhat incomplete.
